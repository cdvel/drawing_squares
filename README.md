## Draw a Square
This is a square of size 4, with 'x' along the edge of the square and space ' ' in the middle of the square.

```
xxxx
x  x
x  x
xxxx
```

Here is the same square represented as a Java string.
String square4 = "xxxx\n" +
"x x\n" +
"x x\n" +
"xxxx";

### Exercise
Write code that given a size can return a string, which represents a square of size with 'x' in the edge and space ' ' in the middle, s s same as the square of size 4 shown above The code needs to be  tested using unit tests comprehensively. The code should be  and there is  , it's enough to have the code run by the tests simple no need to create a main method

## Draw multiple squares
Revisit your program in order to be able to draw multiple squares, by allowing them to be drawn on top of each other. For example, sq3 on top of sq6:


```
xxxxxx
x x  x
xxx  x
x    x
x    x
xxxxxx
```
